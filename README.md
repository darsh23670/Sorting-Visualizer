Sorting Visualizer

A web application that demonstrates the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through interactive animations.

Implemented Algorithms

1)Bubble Sort
2)Selection Sort
3)Insertion Sort
4)Merge Sort
5)Quick Sort
6)Heap Sort

Visualization Features

Color-coded steps for better understanding:

1.Blue – Default (unsorted elements)
2.Yellow – Elements being compared
3.Red – Element in incorrect position (to be moved)
4.Green – Element in the correct position
5.Controls for customization:

Adjustable speed of visualization (5 levels)

--------Change data size dynamically----------
--------Generate new random datasets----------

Algorithm insights:

--->Displays time complexity (Best, Average, Worst cases)
--->Displays space complexity
